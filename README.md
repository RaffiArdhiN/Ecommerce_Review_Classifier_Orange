Overview

The Sentiment Analysis project aims to analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of textual data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of sentiment analysis, including pre-processing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

Features

Text Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.

Feature Extraction: Utilizes techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings.

Machine Learning Models: Implements algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Evaluation Metrics: Measures accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model performance.

Dataset Support: Works with various datasets, including custom datasets.

Modular Design: Easy to extend and customize.

Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. You can download it from Python.org.

Steps

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/RaffiArdhiN/SentimentAnalysis.git
cd SentimentAnalysis

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

1. Preprocess Data

Prepare your dataset by placing it in the data/ folder. Use the following command to preprocess:

python preprocess.py --input data/raw_data.csv --output data/processed_data.csv

2. Train the Model

Train the model using the processed data:

python train.py --data data/processed_data.csv --model output/sentiment_model.pkl

3. Evaluate the Model

Evaluate the trained model on a test set:

python evaluate.py --data data/test_data.csv --model output/sentiment_model.pkl

4. Predict Sentiments

Use the trained model to predict sentiments:

python predict.py --text "I love this product!" --model output/sentiment_model.pkl
